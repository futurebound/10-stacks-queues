# Lab 10 ~ Stacks and Queues Data Structures

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We were tasked to utilize the concepts of Stacks and Queues data structures, implementing constructors for both. The Stack constructor needed to include `push(value)`, `pop()`, and `peek()` methods on the Stack prototype. The Queue constrcutor needed to include `enqueue(value)`, and `dequeue()` methods on the Queue prototype.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.

## Description
In your README, write documentation for you data structures
Your documentation should includes code block usage examples
Provide instructions for:
Installing and using your data structure
Accessing each method
Running your tests
