# Whiteboarding Challenge 12

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge was to imitate a Queue data structure through the use of two Stacks. The `enqueue(val)` and `dequeue()` methods of the Queue class should function normally, where `enqueue(val)` adds a new node instance with the passed value to the back of the Queue, and `dequeue()` removes and returns the node instance at the front of the Queue.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
